### Q1: What is the serving rate for each scenario throughout the day, comparing to the overall serving rate? Serving rate is the number of successfully matched trip in a period of time. For example, is the serving rate higher in the rush hour or at night?

### Answer:
In the above plot, the red solid line shows the serving rate at different hours of the day, and the blue dashed line shows the average/overall serving rate. From this plot it is clearly observable, from 5AM to 12PM and 3PM to 10PM, the serving rate is higher than the average. These hours of the day corresponds to the Rush/Office hours, and using this plot it can be concluded that the serving rate is high during these times.

### Q2: For those trips that could not be served, do they follow a spatial or temporal pattern? For example, are most of those trips originated in particular regions, and of certain times?

### Answer:
The above heatmap shows the spatial distribution of non-served trip requests across different hours of the day. From the map, it can be clearly observed that the epicentres of the unfilled requests shifts throughout the day. During the morning hours, the number of unfulfilled request is high in lower Manhattan, during the day and evening time it shifts to midtown, and again during the night it shifts back to lower Manhattan. The map is helpful in understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of the unserved requests. 

### Q5: What can we learn about the vehicle utilization? Are most of them empty, or with 1, 2, 3 or 4 passengers? Are there particular vehicles that tend to ride with more passengers than others? If so, how are they distributed in space and time.
